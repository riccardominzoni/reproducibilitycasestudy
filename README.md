# Reproducibility Study


## Abstract


Due to the advance of knowledge and technology, the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have grown in recent years leading to a significant increase of published papers. Since that, one of the new challenges in machine learning research is to ensure that presented and published results are sound and reliable. Reproducibility is a necessary step to verify the reliability of research findings.

Yet a $2016$ survey revealed that more than $70$\% of researchers failed in their attempt to reproduce another researcher's experiments, and over $50$\% failed to reproduce one of their own experiments; a state of affairs that has been termed the \textbf{‘reproducibility crisis’} in science.

The purpose of this work is to contribute to the field by reproducing the experiment and results achieved in the paper “Language Representation Models for Fine-Grained Sentiment Classification”, written by Cheang et al. ($2020$)
